# About me
My name is Taylor Wilhelm. I am majoring in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I am going to work on a few school projects for other courses such as creating a matching game. This will advance my skills in GUIs. Another project entails writing a code to crack a 5 character password on a ZIP file. This uses the idea of recursion which is a very useful tool in programming.
